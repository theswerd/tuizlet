# Tuizlet

Tuizlet is an opensource terminal based Quizlet alternative.

It allows you to create, study, and share flashcards in your terminal. It is made to be used with an AI coding agent to generate the quiz files.

## Features

### Maybe features

- [ ] AI deeper integration. Might add claude code sdk for on demand generation, explanations, custom quiz creations, or analytics.
- [ ] Other flashcard games like matching, top down quizzes, etc.
- [ ] Question expiration during learning (5 second timer to answer)
- [ ] Bug me mode — have tuizlet send notifications kinda like Duolingo

### Build in themes

- `purple`
- `sunset`
- `ocean`
- `forest`
- `monochrome`
- `dracula` (of course)
- `nord`
- `solarized`
- `rose`

Beyond `default`, I currently prefer either `purple` or `sunset`.

## Background

I'm studying Spanish and wanted to use Quizlet. Quizlet now costs $10 a month for basic features like studying flashcards. This is my alternative to help me study. In the future I may include tuizlets as part as my onboarding for engineers at my company [Freestyle](https://www.freestyle.sh).
